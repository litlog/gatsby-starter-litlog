The site folder contains a &#x3C;g-link to=\"/litlog/files/\">files&#x3C;/g-link> folder which has the project files in it including a *src/pages/litlog/* folder. This folder \n+contains &#x3C;g-link to=\"/litlog/requests/\">requests&#x3C;/g-link>, &#x3C;g-link to=\"/litlog/tasks/\">tasks&#x3C;/g-link>, and &#x3C;g-link to=\"/litlog/changes/\">changes&#x3C;/g-link>. *slugs* are references to items in these folders.\n+\n+&#x3C;g-link to=\"/litlog/requests/\">requests&#x3C;/g-link> will contain Requests. Requests will have a title, a date, a status (open/closed), and a body which represents the specification of the request. The slug of an individual request is *requests/request-number* where *number* is a one-up number. The body may start as blank but details can be filled in through an iterative process.\n+\n+&#x3C;g-link to=\"/litlog/tasks/\">tasks&#x3C;/g-link> will contain Tasks. Tasks will have a title, date, a status (not-started/in-progress/completed), a request field, and a body which represents the plan and/or execution of the task in ordered steps. The slug of an individual task is *tasks/task-number* where *number* is a one-up number. \n+\n+&#x3C;g-link to=\"/litlog/changes/\">changes&#x3C;/g-link> will contain Changes. Changes will have a title (Create/Update), status (created/creating/updated/updating), and a body which includes details about the change. The gerund version of the verb (creating/updating) indicates work on that file is in process. The past tense version of the verb (created/updated) indicates work on that file is complete. The slug of an individual change is *changes/referent-slug/datetime* where *referent-slug* is the slug of the referent and *datetime* is an [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) when the change was made without the colon between hours and minutes or minutes and seconds (i.e., \"2018-06-08T0800\"). Changes to changes are not recorded since this would be recursive.\n</code></pre>","frontmatter":{"title":"Create"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/changes/requests/request-1/2018-07-31T0144/"}}
